# Linking Writing Processes to Writing Quality

## CS 5665 Group Project - Fall 2023

### Description
The goal of this project was to create a model to predict the final score of an essay based not on the text itself, but on the typing behavior of the student. This was part of a larger Kaggle competition, more information on which can be found here: [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/linking-writing-processes-to-writing-quality)  
This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that form a comprehensive pipeline for the project. The notebooks cover various stages of the data processing and machine learning workflow.
